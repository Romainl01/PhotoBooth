## Documentation Guidelines

Before implementing new features:
1. **Check existing docs** - especially COMPONENT_PATTERNS.md
2. **Follow established patterns** - don't reinvent the wheel
3. **Document as you go** - update docs when patterns change
4. **Archive when done** - move implementation plans to archive/ once completed
